# Machine Learning Pipeline
Notebook dedicated to pipelines, the transition from notebooks to production.

## The model

The model used for this project is a Sklearn pipeline model. The notebook includes the following steps:

- Data preprocessing and normalization
- Numerical and categorical variable encoding
- Feature regularization
- Model selection
- Model training
- Model's parameters adjustment
- Model evaluation
- Export of the pipeline

## Results

The model was trained on 100% of the data using a Cross Validation technique. The model correctly predicted the career length of basketball players with an precision of 76%.

## Conclusion

This notebook shows how to create a pipeline to create a machine learning model that can predict the career length of basketball players.
